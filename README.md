# BDWB Crypto Bot

## Our Purpose

The BDWB Crypto Bot is designed to implement a Warren Buffett-inspired investment philosophy for the crypto world. We focus on building automated trading tools using TradingView and Pine Script that prioritize passive income through DeFi and long-term appreciation of fundamentally strong assets.

### Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Convex for database and real-time data synchronization
- **Authentication**: Convex Auth
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Our Philosophy

### Value Over Hype
We target cryptocurrencies and DeFi projects with real utility rather than meme coins or speculative assets. Our tools help identify assets trading below their intrinsic value, providing a margin of safety for entry.

### Income Is King
We prioritize passive income generation through DeFi mechanisms like staking, yield farming, and liquidity provision. Our strategy mirrors Buffett's love for businesses that produce consistent cash flow.

### Appreciation as a Bonus
While passive income is our primary focus, we also hold assets with long-term growth potential. Our approach combines the best of Buffett's buy-and-hold strategy with the unique opportunities in the crypto space.

### Understand What You Own
We only invest in projects we can thoroughly research and understand - evaluating blockchain utility, team credibility, and adoption trends before committing capital.

## Core Strategy

Our Pine Script tools implement a three-pronged approach:

1. **Value Identification**: Calculate fair value metrics and identify assets trading below their moving averages
2. **Income Focus**: Target coins with high and consistent DeFi yield opportunities
3. **Long-Term Appreciation**: Prioritize cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and growing adoption
4. **Risk Management**: Enter when assets are significantly discounted and implement appropriate stop-losses
